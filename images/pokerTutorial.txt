                           HOW TO PLAY POKER
==============================================================================

Poker is a popular card game that combines skill, strategy, and a bit of luck. 
The most common variant is Texas Hold'em, where players are dealt two private 
cards and share five community cards. The objective is to create the best 
five-card hand using any combination of your two cards and the five community 
cards. Players take turns betting, raising, or folding based on the strength 
of their hands and their assessment of their opponents' potential hands.

The game consists of several rounds: the pre-flop (after players receive their 
two cards), the flop (the first three community cards), the turn (the fourth 
community card), and the river (the fifth and final community card). After 
each round of betting, players can choose to stay in the game or fold. At the 
end of the final betting round, if more than one player remains, a showdown 
occurs where players reveal their hands, and the best hand wins the pot.
