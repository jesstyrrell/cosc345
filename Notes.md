# **Notes** 

## **Little Languages**

A little language is a particularly small domain-specific language designed to be used within the context of a larger system to perform a specific task.

### Why do we have them?
        1. Simplify the problem 
        2. Reduce repitition 
        3. Easy to write 

Example little languages include make, unix shell, latex. 

## **Team Organization**

A team is at least two people, working towards a common goal, each with specific tasks. A good team is greater than the sum of its parts. 

Should keep teams small (less than 10).

With larger teams communication time increases.

To be effective a team needs:
- Direction
- Agreed common goals
- A supportive environment
- Good communications
- Mutual respect
- Commitment 
    - To the team 
    - To the project
- Individual roles

Team Composition:

A team must have complementary personalities, experience, and technical skills.
